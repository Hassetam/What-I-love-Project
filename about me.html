    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Hasset. I love life most when it truly feels alive. I enjoy being around people, and I feel proud when I try new things. I started this project to share the things I love and the moments that make me say, “life is worth living.” </p>
    <p>I'm a student, and this is my first website built with just HTML and CSS. I'd describe myself as having an eldest-daughter personality: caring, responsible, but also full of contradictions.
        I don't live in the middle ground. I can be loud or quiet, serious or funny, a perfectionist, or someone who just doesn't care.</p>
    <p>People often meet the quiet version of me first but give it time, and you'll discover the joy of the group.</p>
    <p>Now that you know me a little better, explore the things I love and see what makes life exciting for me.</p>
